# Airline Customer Satisfaction Prediction Models

My first ever Git project. The goal was to compare several classification methods against one another to predict whether or not airline passengers were satisfied with their experience.

Above are my .ipynb files comparing the classification methods (including xgboost). Interestingly enough, xgboost does not perform best, as I imagined it would, and instead finishes middle-of-the-pack.
